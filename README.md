# Grocery App
This application is a "to do app" program. Some people may also refer to this program as a Shopping List. While developing the program, I benefited from Bradley Traversy's tutorial. However, 
I implemented a few missing functions that I noticed during development myself. Simple. Fast. Offline. Built with pure JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned
I got some hands-on experience working with plain JavaScript. I learned how to revert any element back to its original state after changing it with Vanilla Script.

I revisited functions and got to experiment with reusing them through callbacks.

I worked with event handlers and observed which functions run when they get triggered and in what order.

I got the hang of accessing DOM elements’ properties and targeting elements using Parent and Child relationships.

Lastly, I understood the importance of HTML structure and CSS classes for JavaScript.
